# Hotel-Reservation-Analysis

## As part of my role as a Data Scientist, the manager of a hotel tasked me with analysing the dataset of the hotel to uncover insights and recommendations regarding the notable changes in booking behavior and customer patterns in online hotel reservation channels. Additionally, I was asked to investigate the reasons behind the high volume of hotel reservation cancellations and no-shows.

# To provide insights and recommendations, I followed several steps, including:

* Cleaning the data to make it suitable for analysis.
* Summarising the data using pivot tables to better understand the trends and patterns in the data.
* Generating reports with Pivot table and presenting the findings using charts for better visualisation.
* Creating a dashboard to display the reports and crucial metrics in a clear and concise manner.

# Insights:

* Room Type 1 and Meal Type 1 are the most booked.
* Room Type 4 and 5 have similar cancellation rates to no cancellations.
* Room Type 3 and 7 are not performing well.
* Room Type 2 and 4 are performing significantly worse than Room Type 1.
* Bookings with a planned lead period have the highest cancellation rate.

# Recommendations:

* Conduct more surveys to gather feedback and improve service quality.
* Consider converting more rooms to Room Type 1, which is the most popular option.
* Offer free Meal Type 3 with bookings of Room Type 2 and 4, and reduce the price of Meal Type 2 by 50%.
* Focus on online advertising and partnerships with aviation and corporate companies to attract more online bookings.
* Offer discounts and free airport transportation to customers who book through corporate partnerships.
* Lower weekday prices by 15% and increase weekend prices by 20% to balance out booking demand.
* Host events during weekdays, such as Karaoke on Wednesdays and live bands on Fridays, to attract more bookings.
* Consider implementing a no-refund policy for planned bookings and offer a 25% refund for early bookings.
